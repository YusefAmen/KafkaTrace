- [ ] **Multi-tenancy** - Support for multiple event streams

## üêõ Known Issues

### Development Environment
- **Issue**: Kafka connection timeout on first startup
  - **Status**: Known limitation, requires Kafka to be fully ready
  - **Workaround**: Add retry logic with exponential backoff
  - **Priority**: Medium

- **Issue**: Prometheus metrics not immediately available
  - **Status**: Expected behavior, metrics appear after first events
  - **Workaround**: Send test events to populate metrics
  - **Priority**: Low

### Configuration
- **Issue**: Hardcoded Kafka connection strings
  - **Status**: TODO item for environment variable configuration
  - **Impact**: Limits deployment flexibility
  - **Priority**: High

- **Issue**: Missing health check for Kafka connectivity
  - **Status**: TODO item in service code
  - **Impact**: Services may start before Kafka is ready
  - **Priority**: Medium

## üîß Development Tasks

### Immediate (Next Sprint)
1. **Add Unit Tests**
   - Create pytest test files for both services
   - Mock Kafka connections for isolated testing
   - Test metrics collection and health endpoints

2. **Environment Configuration**
